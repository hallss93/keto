      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >A keto diet is a low-carb diet that results in ketosis. To achieve this, the diet has to be very low in carbohydrates and high in dietary fat, with a moderated amount of proteins.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >This diet involves depleting your body of carbs and forcing it to break down fat for energy.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0.25in 0in 6pt;">
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">What is ketosis?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >Ketosis is a normal metabolic process, something your body does to keep working. When it doesn't have enough carbohydrates from food for your cells to burn for energy, it burns fat instead. As part of this process, it makes ketones.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0.25in 0in 6pt;">
        <span
          style="font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >How long does it take to get into ketosis?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >It will take a few days or weeks to feel your absolute best on keto. It is possible that you may experience symptoms of carbohydrate withdrawal at first, but once you become fat-adapted, you'll find that you won't crave carbs as much anymore.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0.25in 0in 6pt;">
        <span style="font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Is a keto diet safe?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >A keto diet is usually very safe. However, in the following three situations you may need extra preparation or consultation with your doctor:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >- Are you on medication for diabetes (e.g., insulin)?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >- Are you on medication for high blood pressure?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">- Are you breastfeeding?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >If you’re not in one of these situations, you’ll likely do fine on a keto diet, without needing any special modifications.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"

      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >Everyone’s body is different, which means the weight loss rate for each person is different too. For example, someone with a slow metabolism and a lot of fat tissue who doesn’t exercise enough will take longer to see weight loss compared to someone with a normal metabolism who’s slightly overweight and starts exercising four to five times a week along with doing keto.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >Typically, in the first week of the keto diet people see a very quick drop in weight—anywhere from a few pounds to as much as ten! That’s because, at first, keto makes your body release a lot of water weight (not fat) due to your lower carb intake.</span>

        <span
          style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"
        >Water is perfect and includes zero carbs. Coffee and tea (without sugar, of course) are good options, as well. A glass of wine is also fine to drink on special occasions.</span>
